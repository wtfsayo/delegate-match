# Optimism Frame for Governance Accessibility

## Summary

**Develop Farcaster Frame as a scalable governance tool to connect token holders with delegates who share similar values.** Delegates answer a series of 'values' questions in a survey format. Token holders also respond to these questions and receive recommendations for delegates with aligned values.
